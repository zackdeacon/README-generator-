## Description: 

This is my README generator for my homework. Using Node.js I have created a README generator that creates a professional README based on user input generated from Inquirer prompts.

## Installation 

    
  For instillation you will need the Inquirer package with knowledge of fs and Node.js.  
    
## Usage 

    
  after installing, you will initiate the generator in Node. Then you will answer a series of prompts and once you have finished a professional, interactive README will be generated. 
    
## Testing 

    
  I have personally tested this out extensively. I have committed multiple Github pushes to test out layout and performance.
